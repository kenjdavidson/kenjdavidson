## Thanks for swinging by!

Hey, I'm Ken - a developer from Ontario, Canada.  I'm primarily a Java developer, who has been getting more involved with Angular and React (& React Native).  If you'd like to get a better idea of my employment history, please check out my [Linked In](https://linkedin.com/in/kenjdavidson) profile.

### Current Role

Senior Software Engineer @ [Guidewire](https://www.guidewire.com).

### Personal Projects

I've generally always got a few projects on the go, these are the most notable things I'm attempting to keep up to date:

#### [React Native Bluetooth Classic](https://kenjdavidson.com/react-native-bluetooth-classic)

Bluetooth classic/serial module for use with Android and IOS (External Accessory).  Unfortuntely I haven't had the time I used to committed to this project, but I still do my best to:
- Assist with open issues
- Create/Accept pull requests from some wonderful contributers

#### [Yahoo Fantasy Tools](https://github.com/kenjdavidson/yahoo-fantasy-tools)

Attempting to make my (and others) commissioners life a little easy with regards to:
- Custom draft/keeper settings
- Automated team management

#### [kenjdavidson.github.com](https://kenjdavidson.com)

Although I'm not the biggest blogger, I do try to document anything interesting that I've recently worked on (or resolved).  I try not to duplicate topics that are already well documented around the web - there are far better authors than I spending far more time than I.

#### [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4196620/kendavidson)

I've been attempting to get more involved on Stack (although I'm not sure how I feel about it in general).  On top of being able to assist others with their issues, it's a great platform for continuing my own development journey with a lot of languages and frameworks.

### Support

I know a bunch of companies are now using the Bluetooth Classic library, and I'm super stoked about it!   Any bit of appreciation helps:
