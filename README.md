### Thanks for swinging by!

The name's Ken and I'm a developer from Ontario, Canada.  I'm also a father and husband - which has caused my personal project development time to decrease in the last couple years - but I do my best to keep major bugs on public projects resolved.  If you'd like to get a better idea of my employment history, please check out my [Linked In](https://linkedin.com/in/kenjdavidson) profile.

A couple of my primary projects are:

#### kenjdavidson.github.com

My personal site/blog made with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

#### React Native Bluetooth Classic

Bluetooth classic/serial module for use with Android and IOS (External Accessory).
