## Thanks for swinging by!

Hey, I'm Ken; primarily a Java/Kotlin developer with experience using and playing around with React/native, Angular.  I usually have a few projects on the go through the winter months, playing with different frameworks (Unity) and languages (C#, Python); wish me luck!  I tend to keep my [Linked In](https://linkedin.com/in/kenjdavidson) profile up to date if you're interested a little more professional history.

### Current Role

Senior Software Engineer @ [Guidewire](https://www.guidewire.com).

### Spare Time Fun

Or should I say "fun"...

#### [React Native Bluetooth Classic](https://kenjdavidson.com/react-native-bluetooth-classic)

Bluetooth classic/serial module for use with Android and IOS (External Accessory).  Unfortuntely I haven't had the time I used to committed to this project, but I still do my best to:
- Assist with open issues
- Create/Accept pull requests from some wonderful contributers

#### [Yahoo Fantasy Tools](https://github.com/kenjdavidson/yahoo-fantasy-tools)

Attempting to make my (and others) commissioners life a little easy with regards to:
- Custom draft/keeper settings
- Automated team management

#### [kenjdavidson.github.com](https://kenjdavidson.com)

I hate blogging, but I keep attempting to keep this going every now and then.  As of 2024 I'm getting closer to just scrapping the writing portion of the site and replacing it with contact and project lists.

#### [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4196620/kendavidson)

I've been attempting to get more involved on Stack (although I'm not sure how I feel about it in general).  On top of being able to assist others with their issues, it's a great platform for continuing my own development journey with a lot of languages and frameworks.

### Support

If you've come across something I've done which has helped in your day to day life, those companies using the React Native Bluetooth Classic library come to mind, feel free to hook a brother up with a coffee or beer!!!  Never required but would be greatly appreciated.
