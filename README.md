Bluetooth classic/serial module for use with Android and IOS (External Accessory).   Initially reworked from [react-native-bluetooth-serial](https://github.com/rusel1989/react-native-bluetooth-serial) to allow for External Accessory on IOS For my company's mobile app - but since then it's taken off and kept me pretty busy after hours.
