### Thanks for swinging by!

The name's Ken and I'm a developer from Ontario, Canada.  I'm also a father and husband - which has caused my personal project development time to decrease in the last couple years - but I do my best to keep major bugs on public projects resolved.  If you'd like to get a better idea of my employment history, please check out my [Linked In](https://linkedin.com/in/kenjdavidson) profile.

A couple of my primary projects are:

#### [kenjdavidson.github.com](https://kenjdavidson.com)

My personal site/blog made with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

#### [React Native Bluetooth Classic](https://kenjdavidson.com/react-native-bluetooth-classic)

Bluetooth classic/serial module for use with Android and IOS (External Accessory).   Initially reworked from `react-native-bluetooth-serial` to allow for External Accessory on IOS For my company's mobile app - but since then it's taken off and kept me pretty busy after hours.
