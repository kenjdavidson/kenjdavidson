## Thanks for swinging by!

Hey, I'm Ken - a developer from Ontario, Canada.  I'm primarily a Java developer, who has been getting more involved with Angular and React (& React Native).  If you'd like to get a better idea of my employment history, please check out my [Linked In](https://linkedin.com/in/kenjdavidson) profile.

### Current Role

Senior Software Engineer @ [Guidewire](https://www.guidewire.com).

### Personal Projects

A few of my primary personal projects are:

#### [kenjdavidson.github.com](https://kenjdavidson.com)

My personal site/blog made with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).   I'm not the biggest blogger - I tend to write in waves - but I had fun learning Gatsby (among other things) while converting my site from Wordpress.

#### [React Native Bluetooth Classic](https://kenjdavidson.com/react-native-bluetooth-classic)

Bluetooth classic/serial module for use with Android and IOS (External Accessory).   Initially reworked from [react-native-bluetooth-serial](https://github.com/rusel1989/react-native-bluetooth-serial) to allow for External Accessory on IOS For my company's mobile app - but since then it's taken off and kept me pretty busy after hours.

#### [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4196620/kendavidson)

I've been attempting to get more involved on Stack (although I'm not sure how I feel about it in general).  On top of being able to assist others with their issues, it's a great platform for continuing my own development journey with a lot of languages and frameworks.
